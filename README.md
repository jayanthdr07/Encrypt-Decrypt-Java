🔐 Password Encryption Using Java
📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a basic password encryption and decryption system using Java.
The password entered by the user is converted into an encrypted format to prevent direct readability and then decrypted back to verify correctness.
The implementation uses a simple character shifting technique and is written without using any user-defined functions, making it easy for beginners to understand.
🎯 Objectives
Understand the importance of password security
Learn basic encryption and decryption concepts
Implement password protection logic in Java
Practice string and character manipulation
🧠 How Password Encryption Works
User enters a password
Each character in the password is shifted by +3 to encrypt
Encrypted password is stored/displayed
During decryption, each character is shifted by -3 to retrieve the original password
🛠️ Technologies Used
Java
Scanner class
String handling
Loops and type casting
