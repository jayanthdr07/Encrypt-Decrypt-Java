rfrfrfrfrf# 🔐 Password Encryption and Decryption Using Java

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a **simple password encryption and decryption system using Java**.  
The user-entered password is converted into an **encrypted format** to protect it from being read directly and is later **decrypted back** to its original form.

The entire logic is implemented **inside the `main()` method without using any user-defined functions**, making it ideal for beginners and academic projects.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of password encryption and decryption
- Learn basic security techniques using Java
- Practice character and string manipulation
- Implement encryption logic without using functions

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
- The user enters a password
- Each character in the password is shifted by **+3** to encrypt it
- The encrypted password is displayed/stored
- Decryption shifts each character by **-3** to retrieve the original password

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner class
- String handling
- Loops and type casting

-
## ✅ Features
